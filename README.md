This small C++ library intends to provide a simple approach to symbolic algebra. In contrast to
fully-fledged computer algebra systems or libraries (e.g. maxima, GiNaC, sympy), only the most basic
features are implemented and the scope is limited to real-valued symbols: no complex numbers are
taken into account during expression simplification (this prohibits some simplifications and allows
for some). The main features are:

* automatic simplification `a + b + 2*a = 3*a + b`
* expand expressions `(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2*a*b + b^2`
* substitute (sub-)expressions `3*a + b = 6 + b` for `a = 2`
* trigonometric functions `sin(pi/4) = 1/sqrt(2)` or `sin^2(a) + cos^2(a) = 1`
* expression normalization via gcd `a/b + 1/(5*b) = 1/5*(1 + 5*a)/b`
* differentiation `d/da 2*a^4 = 8*a^3`
* solution of simple linear systems of equations
* parsing of expressions from strings
* big integer arithmetic by use of [libgmp](https://gmplib.org)

Most algorithms are implemented according to _Cohen, Computer Algebra and Symbolic Computation
[2003]_, modifications are made for the handling of numeric power expressions and when not taking
complex numbers into account. Absent features that are usually implemented in common CAS are e.g.
arbitrary precision arithmetics for floating point numbers, collecting parts of an expression or
series expansion.


Installation
------------
To compile tsym, you need the [plic](https://github.com/lubgr/plic) library for logging,
[gmp](https://gmplib.org) together with its development headers (`gmp-devel` in Fedora/Suse or
`libgmp-dev` in Debian-base distributions), flex and bison (or their non-GPL counterparts),
C and C++ compiler recent enough to support C++11 and [scons](http://scons.org) as a build system.
For unit tests, [CppUTest](https://github.com/cpputest/cpputest) is required. tsym should build on
all major Linux distributions by e.g.
```bash
scons CFLAGS=-O2 CXXFLAGS="-march=native -O2" lib
```
where the flag specifications are of course optional. See `scons -h` for details. To install header
files and the shared library:
```bash
scons install PREFIX=/usr/local
```
For all available build options and targets, see `scons -h` for details.

Usage
-----
There is only one header that needs to be included: `tsym/tsym.h`. The library provides a
**tsym::Var** class holding all expressions. It can be instantiated as a symbol or a number, and
arithmetic as well as stream operators are overloaded:
```c++
#include <iostream>
#include "tsym/tsym.h"

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    tsym::Var a("a");
    tsym::Var b("b_{subscript}");
    tsym::Var fraction(2, 3);

    std::cout << a + b*fraction << std::endl;
}
```
Variable names and subscripts must be ASCII characters or numbers. A variable name can't start with
a number, curly braces around the subscript can be omitted when it's only one character. Big
integers can be constructed by a digit-only string, and implicit constructors are available for
`int` and `double` arguments, such that intuitive calculations are possible:
```c++
tsym::Var largeInt("98938498203948203948203948209384029384092834098");
tsym::Var a("a");
tsym::Var b; /* Initialized to zero by default constructor. */

b = 2*a + a/1.2345 - largeInt;

/* Careful - this will be zero, because 2/3 is evaluated first and as plain integral type: */
b = 2/3*a;
```
Functions for square root, power, logarithm and (inverse) trigonometric maps including `atan2` as
well as Euler and Pi constants are available inside of the tsym namespace:
```c++
tsym::Var minusPiFourth = tsym::Pi/4 - tsym::asin(1);
tsym::Var onePlusPiFourth = tsym::log(tsym::Euler) + tsym::acos(1/tsym::sqrt(2));
tsym::Var eToTheFour = tsym::pow(tsym::Euler, 4);
```
Information about expressions can be queried via methods of Var:
```c++
tsym::Var b("b");
tsym::Var c = 2*tsym::Var("a")/b/5;

if (c.has(b) && c.type() == tsym::Var::PRODUCT)
    std::cout << "c contains " << b << " and is a " << c.type() << std::endl;

std::cout << c.numerator() << ", " << c.denominator() << std::endl; /* 2*a, 5*b */

c.collectSymbols(); /* Returns a vector containing the symbols a and b. */
c.operands(); /* Returns a vector with a, b^(-1) and the fraction 2/5. */
```
The type() method used in this snippet returns a enum class inside of Var with possible values
`PRODUCT`, `SYMBOL`, `INT`, `FRACTION`, `DOUBLE`, `CONSTANT`, `UNDEFINED`, `FUNCTION`, `SUM` and
`POWER`. Normalization, expansion and differentiation can be done as follows (all methods are
declared const, thus don't modify the object).
```c++
tsym::Var b = tsym::Var("b");
tsym::Var c = tsym::Var("a")/b + 1/(5*b);

std::cout << c.normal() << std::endl; /* 1/5*(1 + 5*a)/b */
std::cout << c.diff(b) << std::endl; /* (-1/5)/b^2 - a/b^2 */

c = c*b;

std::cout << c.expand() << std::endl; /* 1/5 + a */
```
Matrix and a Vector class (simple wrappers around memory management) are provided with standard
operators for addition, subtraction multiplication and the like. They can be constructed by
initializer lists. Linear systems of equations can be solved by the global function `solve`.
```c++
tsym::Matrix M {{ 1, 0 }, { 0, -tsym::cos(2) }};
tsym::Vector rhs(2); /* All entries are default by default. */
tsym::Vector solution;

rhs(0) = tsym::Var(3, 5);
rhs(1) = tsym::Var("a");

std::cout << M.det() << std::endl; /* -cos(2) */

tsym::solve(M, rhs, solution);

std::cout << solution << std::endl; /* [ 3/5, -a/cos(2) ] */
```
The construction of expressions can be done by parsing of strings, too, by invocation of a free
function
```c++
tsym::Var parsedFromString = tsym::parse("a*cos(pi/5) + sqrt(3)*log(euler)");
```
This can go wrong of course, so a flag reference can be passed to check the success of parsing
```c++
bool success;
tsym::Var wrong = tsym::parse("a*cos(3!)", &success); /* Results in a*cos(3). */

if (!success)
    std::cout << "Factorials aren't implemented" << std::endl;
```
The parser does very limited error recovery, you shouldn't rely on it.

Compiling the example code
--------------------------

The exemplary C++ program from above can be compiled with
```bash
g++ -o example main-function-from-above.cpp -ltsym -lplic -lpython3.4m -lgmp
```
for less recent compiler versions, `-std=c++11` should be manually enabled. Note that the version of
the python library should match the one plic is compiled and linked against. If you are unsure, run
```bash
find /usr -type f -path '*plic/buildinfo.h' -exec sed -rn '/python/Is/^.*"(.*)"/\1/p' '{}' \;
```

Additional notes
----------------
* Avoid `using namespace tsym` because `sqrt` and `pow` from math.h are in the global namespace.
  `sqrt(2)` will thus be evaluated to a `double`, while `tsym::sqrt(2)` gives the desired result.
